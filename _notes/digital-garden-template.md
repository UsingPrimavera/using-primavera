title: Digital Garden Template
---
This site uses the free, open-source Digital garden Jekyll template, which is [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).  There is a [step- by-step guide explaining how to set this up from scratch](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll). We use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) so we also read [this guide from Mike](https://refinedmind.co/obsidian-jekyll-workflow) whose spirit we followed, even though we haven't exactly followed the words.

We are grateful to [Maxime Vaillancourt](https://maximevaillancourt.com/) and [Mike Tannenbaum](https://miketannenbaum.com/) for what they have provided for us.
